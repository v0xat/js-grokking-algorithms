# Summary

In technical terms: *at each step you pick the locally optimal solution*, and in the end you’re left with the globally optimal solution. This simple algorithm finds the optimal solution to scheduling problem!

**Approximation algorithm**. When calculating the exact solution will take too much time, an approximation algorithm will work. Approximation algorithms are judged by:

- How fast they are
- How close they are to the optimal solution

**Set**
- A set union means “combine both sets.”
- A set intersection means “find the items that show up in both sets”.
- A set difference means “subtract the items in one set from the items in the other set.”

**Recap**

- Greedy algorithms optimize locally, hoping to end up with a global optimum.
- NP-complete problems have no known fast solution.
- If you have an NP-complete problem, your best bet is to use an approximation algorithm.
- Greedy algorithms are easy to write and fast to run, so they make good approximation algorithms.
