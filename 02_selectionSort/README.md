# Summary

There are two different types of access: *random access* and *sequential access*. Sequential access means reading the elements one by one, starting at the first element. Linked lists can **only** do sequential access.

**Recap**

- When you want to store multiple elements, use an array or a list.
- With an array, all your elements are stored right next to each other.
- With a list, elements are strewn all over, and one element stores the address of the next one.
- Arrays allow fast reads.
- Linked lists allow fast inserts and deletes.
- All elements in the array should be the same type (all ints, all doubles, and so on).
