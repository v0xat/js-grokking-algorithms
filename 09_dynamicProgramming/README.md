# Summary

Dynamic programming is powerful because it can solve subproblems and use those answers to solve the big problem. *Dynamic programming only works when each subproblem is discrete—when it doesn’t depend on other subproblems*.

**Recap**

- Dynamic programming is useful when you’re trying to optimize something given a constraint. In the knapsack problem, you had to maximize the value of the goods you stole, constrained by the size of the knapsack.
- You can use dynamic programming when the problem can be broken into discrete subproblems, and they don’t depend on each other.
- Every dynamic-programming solution involves a grid.
- The values in the cells are usually what you’re trying to optimize.
- Each cell is a subproblem, so think about how you can divide your problem into subproblems.
- There’s no single formula for calculating a dynamic-programming solution.
